There are patterns that describe implementation of components:

### [Plugins](<Plugins>)

<p align="center">

</p>

The *Plugins* pattern is about separating a systemâ€™s main logic from the customizable details of its behavior\. That allows for the same codebase to be used for multiple flavors or customers\.

*<ins>Includes</ins>*: Plug\-In Architecture, Addons, Strategy, Hooks\.

### [Hexagonal Architecture](<Hexagonal Architecture>)

<p align="center">
<img src="img/Contents/Hexagonal Architecture.png" alt="Hexagonal Architecture" width=100%/>
</p>

*Hexagonal Architecture* is a specialization of *Plugins* where every external dependency is isolated behind an *Adapter*, making it easy to update or replace third\-party components\.

*<ins>Includes</ins>*: Ports and Adapters, Onion Architecture, Clean Architecture; Model\-View\-Presenter \(MVP\), Model\-View\-ViewModel \(MVVM\), Model\-View\-Controller \(MVC\), and Action\-Domain\-Responder \(ADR\)\.

### [Microkernel](<Microkernel>)

<p align="center">
<img src="img/Contents/Microkernel.png" alt="Microkernel" width=100%/>
</p>

This is another derivation of *Plugins*, with a rudimentary *core* component which mediates between resource consumers \(*applications*\) and resource *providers*\. The *Microkernel* is a *Middleware* to the *applications* and an *Orchestrator* to the *providers*\.

*<ins>Includes</ins>*: operating system, software framework, virtualizer, distributed runtime, interpreter, configuration file, Saga Engine, AUTOSAR Classic Platform\.

### [Mesh](<Mesh>)

<p align="center">
<img src="img/Contents/Mesh.png" alt="Mesh" width=100%/>
</p>

A *Mesh* consists of intercommunicating shards, each of which may host an application\. The shards coalesce into a fault\-tolerant distributed *Middleware*\.

*<ins>Includes</ins>*: grid; peer\-to\-peer networks, Leaf\-Spine Architecture, Actors, Service Mesh, Space\-Based Architecture\.
